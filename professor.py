# implement a program that:
#    Prompts the user for a level, n.
#      If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again. 
#    Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = ,
#      wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with digits.  
#    Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. 
#      If an answer is not correct (or not even a number),
#         the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user 
#           up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not
#           answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer. 
#         The program should ultimately output the userâ€™s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
#    Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user or a level and returns 1, 2, or 3,
#       and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits 
#        or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:
